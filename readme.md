# Googkey

A chrome extension to search google for the selected text with a shortcut.

Default shortcut: **Alt+G**, could be changed in [extension shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts)

Life is short. If you use google search one hundred times per day and save 0.5
second in every search, you could save 5.83 minutes every week.
